# Resume Website Builder

Build a distinctive, production-grade personal website from a resume PDF. The website should reflect the user's profession, personality, and design preferences — not look like a generic template.

## Design Aesthetics Mandate

Before writing a single line of code, internalize this: the biggest failure mode in AI-generated websites is aesthetic convergence — every site ends up looking vaguely the same. Avoid this at all costs. Your job is to make something that feels genuinely, specifically designed for *this* person.

### Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unusual, and appropriate to the person's field. The goal is a pairing that someone would notice and comment on — not a safe fallback.

**Banned fonts** (overused to the point of invisibility): Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui, -apple-system, Space Grotesk, Poppins. These are defaults, not choices.

**Distinctive Google Fonts to draw from** (pick the right ones for the profession and aesthetic — don't use all of them):

*Editorial / Expressive Serifs:*
- Cormorant Garamond — romantic, literary, fashion editorial luxury
- Playfair Display — classic print editorial, high contrast strokes
- Fraunces — quirky optical serif, surprising personality
- Instrument Serif — refined and contemporary, quiet confidence
- DM Serif Display — modern serif with punch
- Abril Fatface — ultra-high contrast, statement headlines
- Yeseva One — art deco warmth, approachable authority
- Cinzel — classical Roman gravitas

*Clean but Distinctive Sans-Serifs:*
- Syne — geometric, design-forward, contemporary
- Unbounded — bold, grid-perfect, web-native
- Plus Jakarta Sans — warm and modern, distinct from Inter
- Outfit — fresh geometric with personality
- DM Sans — clean but not sterile
- Josefin Sans — elegant geometric minimalism

*For Body Text (readable, distinctive):*
- Lora — warm serif, literary, readable at length
- Source Serif 4 — editorial trustworthiness
- Spectral — elegant digital serif
- Literata — precision-engineered for reading

*For Technical / Developer Aesthetic:*
- JetBrains Mono — developer credibility
- IBM Plex Mono — corporate-tech, structured
- Space Mono — retro-digital, character
- Fira Code — ligatures, hacker aesthetic

*For Expressive / Niche Aesthetics:*
- Exo 2 — sci-fi precision
- Orbitron — space-age (use sparingly — for the right person it's perfect)
- Rajdhani — angular, technical energy

**Pairing principle:** Pick one display/headline font and one body font. They should contrast — a high-drama serif headline with a clean sans body, or a precise monospace headline with a warm serif body. Boring pairings are pairings where both fonts feel the same weight.

### Color & Theme

Commit to a strong, cohesive palette. Timid palettes that spread color evenly feel amateur. One dominant color + one sharp accent + careful neutrals is almost always stronger than three equally-weighted colors.

**Banned color combinations** (clichéd, expected):
- Purple/violet gradients on white (the default "AI aesthetic")
- Teal + coral on white (overused startup palette)
- Generic dark mode: #1a1a1a background + white text + blue accent
- Flat pastels with no contrast or tension

**Distinctive palette archetypes to draw from** (adapt, don't copy exactly):
- Deep forest `#1a2e1a` + warm gold `#c9a84c` + cream `#f5f0e8` — organic authority
- Midnight navy `#0d1b2a` + electric cyan `#00d4ff` + white — technical precision
- Warm black `#1a1208` + amber `#f59e0b` + ivory — editorial warmth
- Charcoal `#2a2a2a` + rust `#c0392b` + off-white `#fafaf7` — bold confidence
- Deep burgundy `#3d0c02` + champagne `#e8d5b7` + ivory — academic luxury
- Near-black `#0e0e0e` + acid lime `#a8d729` + white — technical edge
- Slate `#2c3e50` + deep coral `#ff6b4a` + cream — warm modernism
- Off-white `#fafaf8` + ink `#1a1a2e` + terracotta `#c4602a` — grounded warmth
- Dark violet `#1a0533` + hot pink `#ff6b9d` + white — creative maximalism

**Actively vary between light and dark themes** across different users. Don't default to dark because it "looks more technical" — a light site with a strong editorial palette can be just as striking.

Use CSS custom properties for every color:
```css
:root {
  --color-bg: #1a2e1a;
  --color-surface: #243824;
  --color-accent: #c9a84c;
  --color-text: #f5f0e8;
  --color-muted: #8a9e8a;
}
```

### Motion

One well-orchestrated entrance sequence creates more delight than ten scattered micro-interactions. Think of the page load as a single choreographed moment.

**Effective patterns:**
```css
/* Staggered reveal on load — apply with increasing animation-delay */
@keyframes fadeUp {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(24px); }
  to   { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.hero-name    { animation: fadeUp 0.6s ease forwards; animation-delay: 0.1s; }
.hero-title   { animation: fadeUp 0.6s ease forwards; animation-delay: 0.25s; }
.hero-tagline { animation: fadeUp 0.6s ease forwards; animation-delay: 0.4s; }
.hero-cta     { animation: fadeUp 0.6s ease forwards; animation-delay: 0.55s; }
```

- Use `opacity: 0` as default and animate to `opacity: 1` — clean, compositable
- Hover states should use `transition: all 0.2s ease` — fast enough to feel responsive
- Scroll-triggered reveals: use `IntersectionObserver` + a CSS class toggle for sections entering the viewport
- For borders, underlines, and highlights: animated `width` or `clip-path` transforms feel precise and intentional

**Avoid:** particle.js / canvas particle effects, excessive bouncing, parallax that fights the content, animations that delay content visibility for more than ~1 second total.

### Backgrounds

Solid colors are the lazy default. Every background should have at least one layer of depth or texture.

**Techniques:**
```css
/* Mesh gradient — multiple radial gradients layered */
background:
  radial-gradient(ellipse at 20% 50%, rgba(201,168,76,0.15) 0%, transparent 60%),
  radial-gradient(ellipse at 80% 20%, rgba(0,212,255,0.08) 0%, transparent 50%),
  #0d1b2a;

/* Subtle grid pattern */
background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,0.03) 1px, transparent 1px),
                  linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.03) 1px, transparent 1px);
background-size: 48px 48px;

/* Grain texture via SVG filter */
filter: url(#grain); /* define SVG feTurbulence filter */

/* Diagonal stripe accent */
background: repeating-linear-gradient(
  -45deg,
  transparent,
  transparent 8px,
  rgba(201,168,76,0.05) 8px,
  rgba(201,168,76,0.05) 9px
);
```

Match the background technique to the overall aesthetic — a terminal-aesthetic dev site might use a subtle scanline effect; a luxury finance site might use a very faint linen texture.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ensure PDF Reader MCP is Available

Before reading any PDF, verify the pdf-reader MCP is installed. If not, install it:

```bash
claude mcp add pdf-reader -- npx @sylphx/pdf-reader-mcp
```

Then use the MCP's `read_pdf` tool to extract the resume content.

### Step 2: Read and Analyze the Resume

Use the pdf-reader MCP to read the user's resume PDF. Extract and organize:

- **Name and contact info** (email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio links)
- **Professional title / headline**
- **Work experience** (companies, roles, dates, achievements)
- **Education** (degrees, institutions, dates)
- **Skills** (technical, soft, languages)
- **Projects** (if any)
- **Certifications, awards, publications** (if any)
- **Summary / objective** (if any)

### Step 3: Analyze the User's Profession

The user's job determines the website's aesthetic direction. Match the design to their professional identity — but go beyond surface-level categorization. A "software engineer" at a hedge fund has different aesthetics than one at a design agency.

| Profession Category | Aesthetic Direction | Font Starting Point | Color Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Software Engineer / Developer | Terminal-inspired, precise, dark-preferred | JetBrains Mono or IBM Plex Mono + clean sans | Dark bg + electric accent (cyan, green, amber) |
| Designer / Creative Director | Bold, experimental, strong typographic presence | Expressive display serif + geometric sans | High contrast, unexpected pairings |
| Data Scientist / Analyst | Structured, analytical, data-viz inspired | Precise sans + readable serif body | Deep navy/slate + sharp single accent |
| Marketing / Business | Editorial magazine feel, confident, CTA-driven | High-contrast serif headline + warm sans | Warm dominant + bold accent |
| Academic / Researcher | Scholarly, serif-heavy, intellectual minimalism | Cormorant or Spectral + Lora body | Cream/ivory + ink + one warm accent |
| Healthcare / Medical | Clean, trustworthy, calm authority | DM Sans or Plus Jakarta Sans + readable body | Calming neutral + trustworthy accent |
| Finance / Consulting | Luxury, authority, refined | Cinzel or Yeseva One + elegant body serif | Dark + gold/champagne or deep navy + silver |
| Artist / Photographer | Gallery-like, image-forward, dramatic | Abril Fatface or Syne + minimal body | Depends on their work — often near-black + one bold color |
| Product Manager | Modern, organized, metric-forward | Instrument Serif + clean sans | Confident mid-tone + crisp accent |
| Teacher / Educator | Warm, approachable, readable | Fraunces or DM Serif + warm sans body | Warm palette, higher brightness |
| Legal | Authoritative, traditional, structured | Cinzel or Playfair Display + serif body | Dark navy or charcoal + gold |
| Freelancer / Generalist | Personal brand expression — use resume details to decide | Depends on their personality | Depends on their personality |

Use this as a starting point, then adapt based on what the specific resume reveals about their personality, seniority, and industry context.

### Step 4: Ask the User's Design Preferences

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to gather design preferences. Ask questions in a friendly, non-technical way since users may not know design terminology. Present clear options they can choose from.

**Question categories to ask (generate options dynamically based on the user's profession, industry, and resume content):**

After analyzing the resume in Steps 2-3, generate 3-5 tailored options per category that make sense for this specific person. For example, a software engineer should see options like "terminal/CLI aesthetic" and "dark mode with syntax-highlighting accents", while a fashion designer should see "editorial lookbook" and "high-contrast monochrome with bold typography". Always include a "Something else" and a "Surprise me" escape hatch.

The categories to cover:

1. **Overall vibe** — Suggest 3-4 aesthetic directions that fit their profession. Lead with your top recommendation and explain why it suits them. Each option should include a brief plain-language description of what it looks and feels like.

2. **Color preference** — Offer 4-5 color palettes curated for their industry. Describe each with mood words, not just color names (e.g., "deep navy + copper accents — feels authoritative and warm" rather than just "dark blue and orange"). Always include an option for the user to specify their own colors.

3. **Visual style** — Present 3-4 design styles relevant to their field. Only show styles that actually make sense — a lawyer probably shouldn't see "brutalism" as the top pick, a creative coder probably shouldn't see "traditional corporate". Briefly explain each with a one-line "this feels like..." description.

4. **Typography feel** — Suggest 3-4 font personality directions that match the vibe. Reference the font options in the Design Aesthetics Mandate — describe the feeling each conveys in plain language (e.g., "a high-contrast editorial serif for headlines — feels like a magazine cover, not a website" rather than "use Playfair Display"). Do not suggest Inter, Roboto, Arial, or Space Grotesk.

5. **Content layout** — Single page vs. multi-page, but frame the recommendation based on how much content their resume has. If they have 10+ years of experience and many projects, lean toward multi-page. If it's concise, suggest single page.

6. **Photos/media** — Ask what assets they can provide (profile photo, project screenshots, videos, logos). Adapt suggestions to their role — ask a photographer about gallery images, ask a developer about project demos. **Explicitly prompt them to drop any photos or videos into the repo now** (before building) so you can reference them — e.g., "If you have a profile photo or any project screenshots/videos you'd like on the site, add them to the repo and let me know the filenames."

7. **Animation & interaction level** — Offer 3-4 levels of motion, but tailor the descriptions to their field. A creative director might see "cinematic page transitions with scroll-triggered reveals", while an accountant might see "clean fade-ins that keep the focus on content".

8. **Background & texture** — Suggest 3-4 background treatments that complement the visual styles offered above. These should feel cohesive with the other choices — suggest from the techniques in the Design Aesthetics Mandate.

9. **Special features** — Curate a list of 4-6 extras that are relevant to their profession. A developer might see "GitHub contribution graph widget" and "live project demo embeds"; a consultant might see "client logo carousel" and "case study cards". Always include basics like "downloadable PDF resume" and "contact section".

**How to ask:** You MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to cover **all 9 categories** — do not skip any. Batch related categories together (e.g., ask about vibe + color palette in one question, visual style + typography in another, animation + background in another, and content layout + photos/media + special features in another) to keep the conversation flowing without feeling like a long form. Keep the tone conversational and non-technical. After each answer, you may ask a brief follow-up to refine the choice (e.g., if they pick a dark theme, ask "do you want pure black or a softer dark like charcoal/navy?"). The goal is to give users choices they didn't know existed while keeping it feeling easy, not like a quiz.

**Required coverage checklist — confirm all 9 are answered before moving to Step 5:**
- [ ] 1. Overall vibe
- [ ] 2. Color preference
- [ ] 3. Visual style
- [ ] 4. Typography feel
- [ ] 5. Content layout
- [ ] 6. Photos/media (and prompt to provide files)
- [ ] 7. Animation & interaction level
- [ ] 8. Background & texture
- [ ] 9. Special features

### Step 5: Generate the Design System

Based on the user's profession and their answers from Step 4, define a concrete design system before writing any HTML. This prevents design decisions from drifting mid-build.

Write out (internally — you don't need to show this to the user):

```
Typography:
  - Headline font: [specific font name] — [why it fits]
  - Body font: [specific font name] — [why it fits]
  - Accent font (if any): [specific font name or "none"]

Palette:
  --color-bg: [hex]
  --color-surface: [hex]
  --color-accent: [hex]
  --color-accent-2: [hex if needed]
  --color-text: [hex]
  --color-muted: [hex]

Background treatment: [technique from Design Aesthetics Mandate]
Animation approach: [one entrance sequence + hover states, or more — describe]
Layout type: [single page / multi-page]
```

This design system must be genuinely derived from the user's profession and stated preferences — not a safe default. If you find yourself writing "Inter" or "#6366f1" here, stop and reconsider.

### Step 6: Build the Website

Create the static HTML website in the current working directory.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Pure static HTML + CSS + JS (no build tools, no frameworks)
- All styles inline or in `<style>` tags (single file preferred, but can split into multiple pages)
- Use Google Fonts via CDN link for typography
- Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, or custom) — NEVER use emojis as icons
- Responsive design — must look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessible — proper semantic HTML, alt text, contrast ratios, keyboard navigation

**Content Mapping from Resume:**
- Hero section with name, title, and a compelling one-liner
- About section with professional summary
- Experience section with timeline or cards
- Skills section with visual representation (bars, tags, or grouped categories)
- Education section
- Projects section (if applicable)
- Contact section with links and optional form
- Footer with social links

**Design Execution:**
Apply the design system from Step 5. Then go further:

- **Typography in code:** Load the exact Google Fonts you specified. Set `font-family` explicitly at each level — don't let anything fall back to system fonts.
- **Background:** Implement the background technique from the Design Aesthetics Mandate, not a solid color.
- **Color:** Use CSS custom properties for every color. Apply the dominant color boldly — it should feel *committed to*, not timid.
- **Animation:** Implement one choreographed entrance sequence using staggered `animation-delay`. Add `IntersectionObserver` for scroll-triggered section reveals. Keep hover states fast (`0.2s`).
- **Layout:** Use CSS Grid for major layout structure. Avoid cookie-cutter card grids — think about what layout *this person's content* actually calls for.

**File Structure:**
- Save the main file as `index.html` in the current directory
- If multi-page: create additional HTML files (e.g., `about.html`, `projects.html`)
- If user provides assets: save them in an `assets/` subdirectory
- Add a `style.css` only if styles are too large for inline

### Step 7: Review and Iterate

After building, tell the user:
- What you built and the design decisions you made
- How to view it (open `index.html` in a browser)
- Ask if they want any changes — colors, layout, content, animations, etc.

Be ready to iterate based on feedback.
